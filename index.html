                <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                <p>
                    When a user wants to visit a webpage they input the <strong>Fully Qualified Domain Name
                        (FQDN)</strong> into their browser which resolves the IP address using a <strong>Domain Name
                        System (DNS)</strong> server.
                    The user then connects to the server using the IP address which host the designated homepage. The
                    user's browser loads the designated homepage at the root URL
                    which is typically named <strong>index</strong> with some suffix such as .html, .js, etc. Static
                    content homepages such as this one typically end
                    in .html (hypertext mark up language) whereas dynamically generated homepages end in .js
                    (javascript) or other suffixes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A users Web Dev/Inspector Networks tab output screen displays the <strong>request</strong> and
                    <strong>response</strong> headers which contain valuable information such as
                    status code, type, URL, last time modified, and method. The response body contains the actual data
                    such as the index.html document. If the file is viewed from the web server the URL will
                    contain a FQDN such as https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~amidonk whereas if it viewed from a local
                    machine the url will be displayed in the following format
                    file:///users/kevin/Desktop/CS%290/M1/a1-amidonk/index.html.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <strong>favicon.ico</strong> file has a status code of 200 ok because it was found on the server
                    however the main.css and main.js have a 404 error meaning the files were not found.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A URL can consist of a <strong>scheme</strong>, <strong>subdomain</strong>, <strong>host
                        domain</strong> and <strong>resources</strong>. The scheme is the protocol such as http and
                    https. The subdomain is
                    an optional prefix to the domain name such as www. The host domain is the main address of the
                    website which includes a domain name and a <strong>Top Level Domain (TLD)</strong>. Resources
                    provide the
                    specific location where a requested item can be found. The URL
                    https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~amidonk/CS%20290/M1/a1-amidonk/ contains these components; https
                    is the scheme, web.engr is the subdomain,
                    oregonstate is the host domain, .edu is the TLD, /~amidonk/CS%20290/M1/a1-amidonk/ is the location
                    where the index.html file can be found on the server.

                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                <p><strong>Frontend design</strong> is focused on creating the most useful experience for
                    <strong>users</strong>. It consists of <strong>graphical user-interfaces (GUI)</strong>
                    , the interactive experience and the overal look and feel and design of the page.

                    The Five "E"s of usability define a usable website and are:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Effective</dt>
                    <dd>Users meet their goals and end up with correct results.</dd>
                    <dt>Efficient</dt>
                    <dd>Users are able to perform tasks with the least number of steps and the are results timely.</dd>
                    <dt>Enjoyable/ Engaging</dt>
                    <dd>Users feel engaged and satisified; they are likely to come back.</dd>
                    <dt>Easy to Learn/ Navigate</dt>
                    <dd>Users are able to intuitively use the site and locate the resources they need. </dd>
                    <dt>Error-free/ Error-tolerant</dt>
                    <dd>Users do not run into road blocks or errors.</dd>
                </dl>

                    Page layout <strong>tags</strong> break up the flow of the content and make content more readable. Common page layout tags are the <strong>header</strong> tag which 
                    denotes the banner. The <strong>nav</strong> tag which takes users from the current page to another page. The <strong>main</strong> tag which denotes the core block that 
                    contains content. The <strong>section</strong> tag which is used to make a grouping of content. The <strong>article</strong> tag which is inside a section and denotes a single
                    topic and finally, the <strong>footer</strong> tag which usually holds legal information, contact information and links to critical pages.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Anchors</strong> link to content in the following ways.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>External content - using a URL</li>
                    <li>Internal content - using an ID</li>
                    <li>page-to-page - using an <strong>absolute</strong> or <strong>relative</strong> path</li>
                </ol>
